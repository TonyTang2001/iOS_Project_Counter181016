# Privacy Policy #

The creator of this app, Tony Tang, or TonyTang2001 on GitHub, genuinely advocates the privacy for users in this digital age. Therefore, neither TonyTang2001 nor Count Now collects any personal data from the app's users. 

The owner (Hongyun Ni, my legal guardian) of the developer account, under which I publish this app as a minor, also couldn't have any of users' personal information. Here is a list below about how the app would handle sensitive data by now:

* Count Now does not require your location to function*
* Count Now does not require network connection to function. This makes data transmission between your phone and 
our potential servers technically impossibe*
* Count Now does not require your camera capabilities to function*
* Count Now does not require your microphone capabilities to function*

(* Plus, it does not even request these capabilities)
