# Privacy Policy #

**This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.**

TonyTang developed and owned the Count Now app as a **Free** and **Open Source** app. This SERVICE is provided by TonyTang at no cost and is intended for use as is. Tony Tang, or TonyTang2001 on GitHub, genuinely advocates the privacy for users in this digital age. Therefore, neither TonyTang2001 nor Count Now collects any personal data from the app's users. Here is a list below about how the app would handle sensitive data by now:

* Count Now does not require your location, your camera capabilities, or your microphone capabilities to function*
* Count Now does not require network connection to function. This makes data transmission between your phone and 
our potential servers technically impossibe*

(* The app itself does not even request these capabilities)
